<h2 class="no-break"><a name="Facts_About_the_Green_Goods_Business" id="Facts_About_the_Green_Goods_Business"></a>Facts About the Green Goods Business</h2>


<p>Every good thing has its imitation, and this includes
money. Counterfeiting dates back to the
old Greek and Roman times, and the despicable
business has been kept up ever since, and probably
always will be. In some countries the laws are so
severe that the conviction of a maker or passer of
spurious coin or bills means death. In America
the punishment is usually a long term of imprisonment.
Nevertheless people of dishonest tendencies
seem to have a mania for wanting to
“shove the queer,” and are desirous of going into
the business extensively if they can only find a
manufacturer of bad money who will supply them.
This demand has been the cause of establishing
the trade popularly known as “green goods” business.
The operators are usually in gangs, and
they work scientifically. Perhaps you, respected
reader, have received ere this a very confidential
letter from one Johnson, or Bechtoldt, or Carruthers,
or somebody else, (usually located in
New York, Jersey City or Chicago) telling you
about the “green articles” that they have to sell in
denominations of “tens, twenties,” etc., and assuring
you that they are “perfect in every respect.”
Enclosed with the letter you probably found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
clipping alleged to have been cut out of a newspaper,
telling how a crack counterfeit dealer had
been caught red handed but had passed the ordeal
of a trial and had been acquitted, because the
counterfeits were so good that neither prosecutors,
judge nor jury would dare to say that the
money in evidence was spurious. Yet, the clipping
goes on to say, that it is well known that the
money really was counterfeit, but had been printed
from some plates that had been stolen from the
treasury department, and were, to a certain extent,
genuine.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no plates of money were
ever stolen from the U. S. treasury department,
and the so called newspaper clipping is a concoction
of some ingenious rascal intended to convince
you, if dishonestly inclined, that you can handle
the “green articles” with perfect safety.</p>

<p>The letter doesn’t contain the address of the
dealer; oh, no, he doesn’t do business that way.
You can only reach him by telegraph to an address
given by him, which is no address at all in
reality except perhaps the location of a graveyard
or aqueduct. It has been alleged that the Western
Union Telegraph Company simply holds such
telegrams and they are called for by the men who
expect them and whose swindling game is understood
by the telegraph people. The swindler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sends back an answer by letter, telling the countryman
to come on at once, and saying that he will
meet him upon his arrival at the depot, or at
some hotel, and one is to know the other by means
of a colored handkerchief, a peculiar way of carrying
the cane, or some other signal.</p>

<p>Well, the countryman goes to the city, meets
the knave who shows him in some quiet room, a
package of crisp bills. The countryman opens
his eyes wide and visions of sudden wealth flit
through his brain. Mr. Counterfeiter suggests
that they try some of the bills and see whether or
not they will pass without detection. They drop
into a saloon, and courteous Mr. Counterfeiter insists
that the other have a drink. Perhaps Mr.
Wayback may be a prohibitionist, but that doesn’t
matter as he will certainly be willing to drink a
little pop beer or ginger ale, just to be social.
The city rascal doesn’t even need to wink at the
bartender to cause the latter to drug the drink, as
he is well paid by the gang, and before the countryman
and the city rascal have got far Mr. Wayback
begins to feel stupid, and can be easily induced
to go anywhere his leader suggests while they are
“trying the counterfeit money.” However, the
bills are just as good as gold, being absolutely genuine,
and the “dealer in bad money” can safely
lead his confiding friend into any bank, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
one or two bills changed, just to convince the jay.
Perhaps Mr. Wayback is so thoroughly drugged
that he falls asleep when landed in one of the
out-of-the-way rooms of the gang. In that case it
is an easy matter to drug him more and rob him
of all the good money he possesses, then take him
out after nightfall and leave him to sleep off the
effects of his potion in some alleyway.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the would be rascal of a
countryman keeps awake he will be introduced to
one or two other jolly good fellows, and a transaction
will be made in the aforementioned room.
The two or three thousand dollars in real money
(which the countryman supposes to be excellent
counterfeits) will be wrapped in a package and
sealed. Then the jay will be asked to produce the
$300 or $500 that he is to pay for the pile. While
he is doing this, one of the confederates adroitly
substitutes another package for the one on the
table, being exactly similar in outward appearance
and weight, but filled with sawdust. Mr. Wayback
doesn’t see all this, and the crooks are very clever
withal. About the time that he has his good
money counted to pay over, one of the gang looks
out the window, whispers that two detectives are
approaching, and they suddenly skip, one of them,
of course, grabbing the countryman’s payment,
and hastily suggesting that he take his package<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and get out of the city as soon as possible. This
he will do, and ultimately find out how he has
been swindled.</p>

<p>But what can he do?</p>

<p>He intended to be dishonest, and if he complains
to the police he will be liable to arrest. The
swindlers have got his money, he has obtained the
experience and goes home a sadder but wiser
man.</p>

<p>This game is worked all the year around and it
is astonishing how new “suckers” are obtained so
readily. Police and post office officials use all
sorts of methods to kill the business but their success
is limited. The “green goods” men make
large sums of money and live high.</p>

<p>To all who are looking for counterfeit money let
us say, “Don’t.” You cannot get it anyhow, but
even if you could, the chances are nine in ten that
you would soon occupy a felon’s cell. Seldom a
counterfeiter goes free for long, no matter how
clever he may be. Frequently the styles of “green
goods” invitations are altered, and to one who is
bound to be dishonest, it might appear that, after
all, the special scheme offered him may be all
right&mdash;that is, dishonestly all right&mdash;and that the
counterfeit money can be obtained after negotiations.
But it can’t. We do not deny but that
spurious money is passed, but only in the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
circle of crookdom are such things arranged, and
it would be as easy for a camel to walk through a
key-hole as for any but a “cut and dried” old time
crook to get an “inside” on the counterfeit money
business.</p>

<p>Be honest; it pays. The writer sincerely hopes
that this little volume may be the means of saving
the money of many a man, and of diverting his
ideas in a more legitimate direction. Let such as
are tempted by the “green goods” monster, and
who have money that they could invest, put such
money in the savings bank at a small per cent.
The result will be a fair income, but better still, a
<em>clear conscience</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="Extensive_Mailing" id="Extensive_Mailing"></a>Extensive Mailing.</h2>


<p>Here is a statement about the extensive mailing
of “green goods” circulars. The story was told
by Van Buren before the Lexow committee in 1894.</p>

<p>Benjamin D. Van Buren, a discharged chief
clerk of the Jersey City post office, told a startling
story.</p>

<p>“I was chief mailing clerk,” said Mr. Van Buren.
“My attention was first called to the green goods
business about eight years ago. The first thing
that I noticed was the hiring of boxes by green
goods men. I knew them by sight only. This
lasted two or three months. Then my attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was attracted to some stories in the newspapers
about the stopping of circulars at the New York
post office. Large amounts of mail were stopped
there. Then came some men with big bundles of
circulars without the “return” stamp on them. I
suspected they were green goods circulars stopped
at the New York post office. I went to Postmaster
Dickerson with my suspicions, and he told
me to keep a strict watch and see if I could find
an envelope open. I did in a few days, and found
one of the regular circulars in it. I gave it to the
assistant postmaster, who took it to Inspector
James in New York. Then Postmaster Dickerson
ordered me to send the matter out. Later on
it was discussed with Inspector Egerton of Philadelphia,
who has charge of the postal district in
which Jersey City is located; and the rule went
forth to forward at once, regardless of character.
Immense quantities of green goods circulars were
then handled from that office. After a time the
circulars came in such quantities that they were
not put through the windows, but taken around to
the back door, the same as other big users of the
mails. Postage stamps were sold in big lots by
the assistant postmaster to the green goods men.
I should say they must have bought $500 or $600
worth a day.”</p>

<h2><a name="New_Dodges" id="New_Dodges"></a>New Dodges.</h2>


<p>The following interesting story appeared in the
<cite>New York Herald</cite> of February 10, 1895, and indicates
that there has been but little cessation in the
“green goods” business:</p>

<p>Mr. Hace Ead, of Texas, who comes on to New
York every spring to buy “green goods,” and who
each time takes home a valise full of bricks, but
who, nevertheless, returns to the business again,
hoping against hope, will have no more difficulty
in making his purchases this year than he had
last. The “green goods” men are still at their
games, flooding the country with circulars and
disposing of bags of rubbish at fabulous prices.</p>

<p>The revelations before the Lexow committee
did not have the effect of driving the “sharps”
into legitimate occupations. While the testimony
was being given against them they kept in retreat
in Jersey City, but even during the hearing of
the “green goods” witnesses, “come-ons” were
arriving in shoals at all the Jersey City depots,
and the brick maker who supplies the swindlers
at wholesale prices made his usual daily deliveries
at their offices. The bricks, carefully wrapped up
in paper, were distributed to the four corners of
the United States.</p>

<p>John Sheffield, of Manchester, N. Y., who came
to Jersey City recently to rob the “green goods”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
men, and who did steal $1,600 from two of them,
says that a large part of the savings of residents
in his town has gone to the operators in this city.
It was to get revenge and to obtain some of these
savings back that Sheffield came along. The
place where the operators said they would meet
him at No. 87 West street, New York, but he preferred
to do business with them in his room at
Taylor’s Hotel, in Jersey City, where he kept his
black jack, and where he succeeded in disabling
one of the men who wanted to jabe him in the eye
with an umbrella and recover the money.</p>

<p>The “green goods” men live in New York still.
They always did a good deal of their business in
Jersey City, and they do it there now. Some of
the odd looking farmers who come from the central
part of New York State, and who have never
seen a piece of water so large that it could not be
crossed by a bridge, are afraid to trust themselves
to the ferryboats. As soon as they see the river
they rebel, and positively refuse to leave dry
ground. This necessitates a good deal of the business
being done in Jersey City. Another reason
for the selection of that town originally was the
cheapness of police “protection” as compared
with its cost in this city.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="DISLIKE_TO_BE_FOUND_OUT" id="DISLIKE_TO_BE_FOUND_OUT"></a>DISLIKE TO BE FOUND OUT.</h2>


<p>There are still other reasons. A “come-on” is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
frequently a wild looking being, with lengthy hair
and an embarrassed manner, who continually falls
over himself and gets buncoed or robbed before
he reaches the swindlers to whom he morally
belongs. “If he is a queer sight,” said an operator,
“he won’t attract so much attention in
Jersey City as he would in New York.”</p>

<p>Chief of Police Murphy told me the other day
that there were many “green goods” men quartered
in his bailiwick in temporary exile. They
received visits from men who might be customers
and who might be clergymen trying to convert
them. It was hard to get evidence against these
criminals, as their victims are as interested in not
being found out as are the operators themselves.
They continue to take many of the “come-ons” to
Bound Brook and there perform the final act in
financial juggle.</p>

<p>There “green goods” men who used to be very
active in catching and despoiling “come-ons,” but
who now say that they have reformed and are
leading simple Christian lives, are John Morgan,
James Wilson and Michael Ryan. If they have
really become converts to religion the business
they have gone into is probably that of guides,
for they are seen meeting strange looking men
with chin whiskers, wide hats, carpet bags and
agricultural boots at the trains. In a short time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sometimes only two or three hours, these same
men reappear at the ferry or railroad station
carrying a valise that they did not have with them
when they arrived.</p>

<p>So easily identified are the “come-ons” that the
ferry employes recognized them half a block
away. Sometimes they call out to each other so
that the “come-ons” can hear:&mdash;“I’ll bet that fellow
has $10,000 in that bag,” or “Looks like a
counterfeiter.” Then they enjoy the alarm of
the “come-on,” who turns pale and escapes as
quickly as he possibly can.</p>

<p>At the Pennsylvania Railroad ferry in Jersey
City there is a youth representing the “green
goods” men continually on the watch. He scans
the faces of all passers by and looks out carefully
for detectives. Knowing all the employes of the
police department by sight he can get an idea if
there is anything unusual going on, or if the department
is on the watch for some criminal.
This youth was pointed out to me yesterday by a
private detective once in the employ of the Law
and Order Society, and who told me that the
“green goods” men were still doing business on a
large scale, though they were not so bold as before
the sessions of the Lexow committee.</p>

<p>Some of the operators have been robbed lately
by “come-ons.” So great has been the publicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the exposure of the business that it is hard to
realize that there can be a single man in the
country who could be gulled by it, but still hundreds
of New Yorkers make a fat living off “green
goods.” During the Lexow investigation a few
of the Jersey City operators who did not know
human nature very well thought that the end of
the “green goods” trade had been reached, and
that they would have to think up some new
scheme for making a dishonest living.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="NEW_SWINDLING_GAME" id="NEW_SWINDLING_GAME"></a>NEW SWINDLING GAME.</h2>


<p>One of the tricks that has superceded “green
goods” is the “country postmaster,” or “red
goods” game. A circular is sent to postmasters
in out-of-the-way towns where the level of intelligence
is supposed to be very low, informing them
that the writers have become possessed of a large
quantity of postage stamps, and are waiting for a
chance to sell them at from thirty-five cents to
fifty cents on the dollar, according to the quantity
taken.</p>

<p>After this the modus operandi is precisely similar
to that employed in the “green goods” game.
The victim is shown a lot of postage stamps,
which are then packed in a valise, and at the last
moment the valise is changed for one containing
mud or stones or a brick.</p>

<p>This has not the same field as the “green goods”
game, as the number of postmasters is limited,
and in little towns their opportunities are smaller
for disposing of any great quantities of stamps.
It was invented by operators who had been
clubbed or beaten by “come-ons” familiar with
their game, and who decided that a change of
ground was necessary. But it can hardly be said
to have scored a hit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The police have made a statement to the effect
that Harlem is now free from “green goods”
men, but it must be remembered that at all times,
even when Harlem was overrun with the swindlers,
the police have issued similar proclamations. It
has been said that Captain Thompson, of the
West 125th street station, has made an arrangement
with the Western Union Telegraph Company
by which all “green goods” messages shall be
shown to him. This statement is made in order
to show the vigilance of the police and the change
of heart of the telegraph company, which has
derived a large income from the swindlers, it being
alleged that the company had a regular
“green goods” department to look after that
branch of the trade and to see that the operators
got what they wanted.</p>

<p>It is denied, however, that the Western Union
people could show telegrams to the police. It is
against the law, for one thing, and any company
that did not guarantee the secrecy of its messages
would soon begin to lose its business.</p>

he speculates in this class of stock, goes in without
regard for the proprieties, for the purpose of
making whatever he can out of the scheme, and,
if he gets the supply as promised, feels satisfied
with the arrangement.</p>

<p>This new idea is something of a variation on the
old plan, however, in that it swindles the man
who is himself contemplating a swindle on his
neighbors and on the government. Instead of
sending the customer “green” goods, the swindlers
send him a lot of confederate money.</p>

<p>Here is the way the new circular reads:</p>

<p>“Esteemed Sir&mdash;You have been recommended
to me as being a person in whom I can place
implicit faith; who will deal with me honestly and
work for mutual interests. I therefore write you
this confidential letter, trusting to your honor to
use me fairly.</p>

<p>“My business is peculiar. I deal in money of
several kinds. I want a shrewd, careful and
energetic person in your locality to handle a
branch of my business. Probably you are not
wealthy, but you can recall some others who have
quite suddenly achieved wealth, and the public
has never known just how. Mine is a money
making method, and will enable you to acquire
good cash by exchanging bank bills for coins, etc.</p>

<p>“I will not go into details in this letter, but if
you will send me $2, I will send you samples of
money representing $50, also complete confidential
instructions, lists of prices of various denominations
of money.</p>

<p>“The above will enable you to get a proper
start, and if you go into the business on a large
scale, I will arrange to pay your expenses to Boston,
where we can have a personal private conference
and make negotiations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“I enclose a strong envelope, addressed, in
which you can place your $2, and it will reach
me safely. Rest assured I shall deal with you
fairly, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and I expect the same treatment
in return.</p>

<p>“P. S.&mdash;The samples of money that I will send
you are printed from original government plates,
therefore, are not counterfeit (or imitation)
money.”</p>

<p>It is necessary to read the letter twice in order
to appreciate the fine points of composition, the
seductive tone of the epistle, and yet, the clever
way in which the writer avoids making any damaging
admissions.</p>

<p>The opening and the general style is that of the
regular “green goods” letter, but it differs in two
important points&mdash;its tone is not so secret as those
epistles generally are, and the address of the
sender is given. Furthermore the customer is not
required to answer by a secret telegraphic message.</p>

<p>The postscript is particularly inviting, as the
writer guaranteed to send money from original
government plates, and not counterfeits.</p>

<h2><a name="This_is_Literally_True" id="This_is_Literally_True"></a>This is Literally True,</h2>


<p>but the writer forgets to state that the government
which is represented on the money went out of
existence about 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Confederate money is what will be sent, and the
agreement will be literally carried out so far as
the amount specified goes. If the customer
“kicks,” he is bound hand and foot, so to speak,
for he has made himself a party to the fraud by
sending for the article advertised, and which is
really much worse than what he receives.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
